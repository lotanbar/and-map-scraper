Fix those problems yourself: Try to do those youreslef!! It could be a nice project!
    Same gap for buttons
    a bit less wait after scroll in screenshot.
    Perhaps a fast scroll?
    BIGGER square
    after go down a line, wait relative to the number of left horizontal scrolls
    zoom buttons crashes for long tiles - perhaps we can show feedback?
